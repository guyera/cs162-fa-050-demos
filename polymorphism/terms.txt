Early binding: Look at a function call, and decide WHICH function it should execute. Early -> happens at COMPILE time based on STATIC types.
Late binding: Binding function calls at RUNTIME based on DYNAMIC types =

Static type: Declared type of the variable
Dynamic type: "ACTUAL" type of the underlying data

vtable: The place in memory within an object that stores the object's pointers to its overrides of its virtual functions

abstract type: Any class with at LEAST ONE pure virtual function
